# PolyGPT Project

### Introduction
Welcome to the PolyGPT project! PolyGPT is an ambitious undertaking aimed at developing an optimal Bayesian agent with the ability to self-learn, self-grow, and self-evolve using cutting-edge techniques such as Bayesian deep learning and hyperbolic deep learning. In this README, we'll provide an overview of the project's goals and vision.

### Project Goals
PolyGPT's primary objective is to create an advanced AI agent capable of making optimal decisions based on the information it possesses. Here are the key objectives:

- Short-Term Goals: Initially, our focus is on participating in hackathons to generate code and generate revenue. This will provide us with the resources needed for further research and development.

- Long-Term Vision: The ultimate goal is to transform PolyGPT into an optimal Bayesian agent, a concept inspired by Nick Bostrom's book, "Superintelligence." An optimal Bayesian agent is one that can update its beliefs perfectly according to Bayesian's theorem when presented with new evidence.

Bayesian and Hyperbolic Deep Learning: To achieve this vision, we aim to leverage Bayesian deep learning and hyperbolic deep learning techniques to embed information in hyperbolic space. This approach can offer better ways to understand and process data.

**Self-Improvement: Just like true AGI, the core of PolyGPT is its ability to self-learn, self-grow, and self-evolve. It will continually refine its understanding and beliefs as it gains more information and experiences.**

#### Why PolyGPT?
The motivation behind PolyGPT is to explore avenues beyond the conventional approaches to AGI. While many are focused on large language models (LLMs) and optimization techniques, we aim to investigate the potential of optimal Bayesian agents as a pathway to AGI.
